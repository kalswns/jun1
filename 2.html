<h2>Party Game</h2>
<p>Party games are games that are played at social gatherings to facilitate interaction and provide entertainment and recreation. Categories include (explicit) icebreaker,
   parlour (indoor), picnic (outdoor), and large group games.[1][2] Other types include pairing off (partnered) games, and parlour races. Different games will generate
   different atmospheres so the party game may merely be intended as an icebreakers, or the sole purpose for or structure of the party. As such, party games aim to include players of various
   skill levels and player-elimination is rare.[3] Party games are intended to be played socially, and are designed to be easy for new players to learn.
